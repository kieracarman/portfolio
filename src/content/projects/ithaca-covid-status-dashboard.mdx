This minimalistic app fetches covid data from the Tompkins County Health Department and parses out the most important numbers to show the general status of covid risk in the area.

I created this app because I felt like the health department's website was too complicated, and I wanted a super quick overview of the community transmission and case data to guage infection risk in real time.

I wrote an API route that uses Axios to fetch CSV data from a public Google Sheet updated by the health department, then return the important data as JSON which is then displayed on the page. This project utilizes the server-side rendering built in to Next.js to serve fully rendered content to the client.
