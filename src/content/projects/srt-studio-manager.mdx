This web app is one of my work-in-progress projects.

I developed this concept while chatting with my dad, who manages sound recording facilities at a university. He expressed a need for a management platform, to assist with his responsibilities including keeping track of physical and non-physical assets, studio bookings, and managing support requests when things break or go missing.

The scope of this project includes multiple RESTful APIs to manage all of the different data involved, as well as integration with the university's Active Directory to enable students and faculty to log in with their SSO .edu email address and password.
